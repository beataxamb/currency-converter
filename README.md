## Description

I am taking a programming course and I made this currency converter for my homework. This website contains a simple currency calculator that shows how to do calculations using java script. I also added css styles to improve the visual appearance of the calculator to make it more pleasant to use.

**I invite you to see the effects of my work!**

## How to use

In the upper window, enter the amount in zlotys, but not less than 10. Then select the currency and click the button "przelicz". Below you will see the amount you will get in the currency you have chosen. If you want to enter a different amount, you can delete it by clicking on the button "Wyczyść".
